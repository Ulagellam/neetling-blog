Did you like this blog so much that you want to know how I made it?

Then, this post will answer all your questions!

I made this blog website in around an hour using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

## Docusaurus
Docusaurus is a framework built on top of [React](https://react.dev/) and powered by MDX. 

Using it to create docs or a blog is REALLY easy!

#### Here’s what I did step-by-step:

{/* truncate */}

1. I downloaded `create-docusaurus`, an `npx` script that generates a docusaurus project for you.
2. Generated a project called `neetling-blog`.
3. Removed `index.js`, the `docs` folder, and some configs related to both.
4. Changed the primary dark and light colors in `custom.css` to match Neetling’s theme.
5. Updated the authors, tags, and other config from the example content.

That’s it! Yeah, that’s how easy it is to make a blog with Docusaurus!

## MDX
You might be wondering:
> Where does MDX come into all this?

There’s a secret sixth step - writing the post you’re reading right now!

Yes, this post is made with MDX.

#### Here's the difference between MD and MDX:

With MDX, you can make your blog interactive since MDX is basically MD + [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx).
For example, you can use JSX to create an interactive button:

```jsx live
<button onClick={() => alert('BOOOOO!')} style={{padding: 10}}>Click me if you have the courage!</button>
```

<details>

  <p>
  Good question! Here are the steps I followed to add it:

  1. Download `@docusaurus/theme-live-codeblock`
  2. Add it to `themes` in `docusaurus.config.ts`
  3. Used the `live` modifier on a code block like this:

    ````md {1}
    ```jsx live
        <button onClick={() => alert('BOOOOO!')} style={{padding: 10}}>Click me if you have the courage!</button>
    ```
    ````
    </p>
</details>
